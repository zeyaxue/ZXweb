<h3 id="deja-vu-about-a-10-year-old-me">Deja vu about a 10-year-old me</h3>

<p>I was taught how to embroider by my grandma back when I was 10 years old. It was summer time with no school but the weather is unbearaly hot with high humidity. I did not feel like going outside and play with other kids in the heat. Then, I saw my grandma sewing something and I became interested and probably baggered her to let me play with needles and threads. Wise grandma said, sewing might be too boring for you, let me teach you how to embroider. And grandma was absolutely right, I loved embroidering all summer long. Even when the weather got cooler, I still stayed indoors to embroider as I listened to my friends playing and chattering through the window. However, when I started middle school at a boarding school, I became busy with study and gradually dropped this hobby.I remembered that I stitched butterflies and deers to my handkerchief and towels. I&rsquo;ll add the pictures if I can find those relics next time I go to grandma&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Back in August, as I was wrapping up thesis writing and job searching, I found myself have free time for leisure without feeling guility, for the first time in 14 years. The number, 14 years, is the sum of 2 years in middle school (boarding school), 3 years in high school (boarding as well), 4 years in college, and 5 years in grad school. However, I had no idea what to do with myself with the newly found free time. As a result, I focused way too much energy on the other mammmels under the same roof (i.e. my cats, not my husband). I worry about their behaviors, appetite and droppings all the time. I would fret over things like Taco only ate 80% of what he normally eat todys, and why is he not overly zestive when I was distributing his food.<img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/IMG_8795.JPG" alt="Taco the cat" width="50%"/> Usually, he would paw (slap) me if I didn&rsquo;t set the food down within 1 mili seconds, but why is he just sitting there and politely wairing for his food? Or, I would follow Noodles&rsquo;s every move around the apartment becasue she only peed once today. <img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/IMG_8578.jpg" alt="Noodles the cat" width="50%"/> I admit, I <em>may</em> have became obssevie with my cats to the point that my husband complains that he thinks I love the cats more than him and he suggested me to get a REAL hobby other than overzestive cat watching. This is when hand embroidery re-entered my life, only this time I didn&rsquo;t have a grandma around to provide me with all things necessary. Therefore, I turned to the next best thing, Amazon, and bought a couple of stitch kit and a lot of embroidery floss.</p>

<h3 id="embroidery-projects-and-things-i-learned">Embroidery projects and things I learned</h3>

<ol>
<li>Feliz navidad snowman
<img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/Feliz navidad.jpg" alt="Feliz navidad snowman" width="50%"/>
I purchased this stitching kit from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KPLN82C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Amazon</a>. Although the product page claimed that the text on the piece is &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo;, the actual cloth came with the text pattern of &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo;. Hmmm&hellip;I wanted to give this as a finished piece for my grandma-in-law, who is Hispanic, as a Christmas gift. Therefore, I decided to get a little bit creative and added &ldquo;FELIZ navidad&rdquo;, which is Spanish for &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo;. I also googled for fancy fonts and decided to adopt the hybrid font with &ldquo;FELIZ&rdquo; in all caps and &ldquo;navidad&rdquo; in semi-cursive and a flare of my cheesy heart desgin on the &ldquo;i&rdquo;. I finished embroider everything else except the text and washed the cloth to remove the &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; pattern. After the cloth is dry, I wrote &ldquo;FELIZ navidad&rdquo; on the cloth with a heat-erasible marking pen and embroidered the text. Afterward, I ironed the piece to simultaneously remove my writing and flatten the crumbled surface due to washing.</li>
</ol>

<p>I liked the chain stitch on the grey part of the hat. The chains make it resembled wool hats. I wished I had also did chain stitches on the red portion to give the hat an overall &ldquo;wool&rdquo; look. Speaking of chain stitches, I think this stitch is horrible for the &ldquo;arm&rdquo; as the stitches are loose and make the arms disproportionally swollen. In hindsight, I also would like to use 2 threads for the snowflakes instead of 3 threads to make them less chunky.</p>

<ol>
<li>Flower ring
The second kit I bought from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QNSGFB2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Amazon</a> is a flower ring design. I decided to give this as a gift to my mother-in-law so I personalized this piece with her name in the flower center. I used her favorite color, purple, to embroider her name.
<img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/Esther flower ring2.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/></li>
</ol>

<p>Somethings I would like to be better at is the satin stitches for the roses and the woven roses. For the satin-stitched rose, I wasn&rsquo;t able to provide equal coverage throughout each pedal</p>

<ol>
<li>Pillowcase
I also did some small embroidery pieces for pillowcases in order to differentiate which pillow is mine and which pillow is my husband&rsquo;s.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/pillowcase flowers.jpg" alt="" width="40%"/>
I did a small cluster of flowers for mine. I am pretty satisfied with the result but I am slightly worried that this dimensional embroidery (the woven rose) will be dismembered during laundry. Therefore, I sewed the bottom of the woven roses about 6 times and tied 3 knot per each thread start and end.</p>

<p><img src="/post/2019-09-24-rekindled-love-for-an-old-hobby-hand-embroidery_files/pillowcase Tubbs cat.jpg" alt="" width="40%"/>
I embroidered my husband&rsquo;s pillowcase with a chubby cat wearing a tophat per my his request. I named it Tubbs, which is a chubby cat from the &ldquo;kitty collector&rdquo; game <a href="https://www.nekoatsume.com/en/">neko atsume</a>. I used DMCxx, which has shimmer within the threads, for embroidering the tophat. If you look really really closely, you can find a teeny bit of glitter that catches your eye (or maybe not). Also, the tophat is a bit too much on the left side, the right ear is not pointy and the bowtie is not symmetrical&hellip;.It is hard to be a <a href="https://www.needlenthread.com/2015/07/sewing-vs-stabbing-two-methods-of-stitching.html">&ldquo;stabber&rdquo;</a> embroider while working on pillowcases because I can really access the back side of the hooped cloth. I had to reach into the opening of the pillowcase and blindly acess the backside.</p>

<p>Future projects
  - I want to work on keep the back of my embroidery clean and neat. I am not showing you any back of my embroidery piece now. They are pretty bad and I am embarassed to show you.
  - Embroider on sheer fabric, such as tulle, to create a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; auro for the embroidery pieces. To see what I am talking about, you can find gorgeous examples <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/krista-decor-tulle-embroidery-art/">here</a>. Because the fabric is transparent, I can&rsquo;t hide messy strings and knots in the back, which is why I was inspired to practice keep the back clean.
  - Lastly, an ambitious goal of needle painting. I would like to embroider my cats like the awesome artisit, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emillieferris/?hl=en">@emillieferris</a>.
I will update you on my journey of embroidery beginner to above intermediate levels (and if I ever get to the expert level).</p>
