      <description>On June 13, I had my PhD commencement. However, the ceremony itself is not an end to my PhD life, I was still &amp;ldquo;neck deep&amp;rdquo; in writing/modifying disseration for the past month or so. I have sent my dissertation draft to my committee members and now I can finally catch a breath and make a post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a professional shot picture (i.e. $20 per photo) of my PI, Maria Marco and I.</description>

      <description> Hello world! This is the 1st post as a test for using Blogdown to make a website with Huabing’s clean white theme for Hugo.
Acutal life note: I came back from dinner at Wen and Nada’s place. As usual, they are uber nice and I’m amazed by how agile Wen is at the age of 95. Wish him good health for many years to come!!!
