      <description>Deja vu about a 10-year-old me I was taught how to embroider by my grandma back I was 10 years old. It was summertime with no school but the weather is unbearably hot with high humidity. I did not feel like going outside and play with other kids in the heat. Then, I saw my grandma sewing something and I became interested and begged her to let me play with needles and threads.</description>

      <description>On June 13, I had my PhD commencement. However, the ceremony itself is not an end to my PhD life, I was still &amp;ldquo;neck-deep&amp;rdquo; in writing/modifying dissertation for the past month or so. I have sent my dissertation draft to my committee members and now I can finally catch a breath and make a post.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a professional shot picture (i.e. $20 per photo) of my PI, Maria Marco and I.</description>

      <description> Hello world! This is the 1st post as a test for using Blogdown to make a website with Huabing’s clean white theme for Hugo.
Acutal life note: I came back from dinner at Wen and Nada’s place. As usual, they are uber nice and I’m amazed by how agile Wen is at the age of 95. Wish him good health for many years to come!!!
